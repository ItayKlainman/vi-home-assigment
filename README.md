Itay Klainman - Vi home assignment.

First of all i'd like to say that this assigment was very fun! I've learned a lot and got to deal with interesting challanges! 

Few things to notice before trying the project: 
- There is an occasional error that pops up by TextMeshPro. I tried to handle it but could not find a solution online.
- I wanted to add a delete data function but unfortunately did not get to it. if needed ill grant access to the DB in order to test further. 
- I could have made another interface for custom serialzing of json, thus making the system a bit more flexable. 
- I also could have added a queue for the SaveManager class for more scalability but that was out of the scope.

Overall I had a great time and learned alot. 
If there are any questions about the project please feel free to contact me!
