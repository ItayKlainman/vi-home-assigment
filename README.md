## What & how we test?

● We are checking your **Unity General Knowledge** & Advanced Knowledge

● We evaluate how **“Clean” and readable** your code is

● **Scalable** code is very important to us - should try to be generic

● Understanding how you **approach a problem**

● Knowledge of SOLID Principles and **Design Patterns** as Needed

● We check the way you understand and implement Technical Tasks


## Tasks - Generic Service for any game

● Open the project in unity

● Make sure code is separated to different ASMDEFs and Namespaces
1. [ ] Create a new ASMDEFs as needed
2. [ ] Try to think why and what to split, what they should use

● Design and Develop Cloud Save Manager 
1. [ ] Use any 3rd party or db you prefer, for example firebase storage
2. [ ] Create a small Tech-design of how you are going to writer the system
3. [ ] Should include - (suggestion, if you prefer can design differently)
   1. [ ] Save - Save Method, get a class of data and save it as json 
   2. [ ] Load - Load Method, Load by type
   3. [ ] Please try to use generic code, so it will be easy to tag any class we want for saving

● Example Scripts on a game object to show how to use the service
1. [ ] Create script to enable us to test the service,
2. [ ] Also add some fake data classes we will be able to save and load
